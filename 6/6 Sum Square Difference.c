    Sum Square Difference
    
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
        12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385    
    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
        (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
        
    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
    ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first
    one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

/* Interesting Notes
    If counting numbers are treated as variables
    then the answer equals twice the triangle of monomials.
    
    There are other mathematical beauties behind this problem...
    
    hmm answer = n*(n+1)*(3*n*n-n-2)/12 where n = number of digits
